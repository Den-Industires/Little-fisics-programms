# Little-fisics-programms
There are fisics programm, which do some fisics stuff.

There are two fisics programm for fisics. I made it with SFML on c++. In future there may be other programms.

For installation you should just unzip the zip and find an exe, that's all.

First programm is flight path. This programm show a flight path of little ball. I am not entirely sure in realistic of this programm, but never mind.

Second programm is oscilloscope. I like this programm. It shows you electrical signal, which specifications you can edit with bottoms.

Have fun.
